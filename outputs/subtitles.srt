Good evening, and welcome to our evening news broadcast

2
00:00:07,896 --> 00:00:15,792
Today, we're focusing on the latest developments in politics, particularly in the state of Telangana

3
00:00:15,792 --> 00:00:23,688
First up, a new report suggests that millionaires who threaten to leave their home countries due to high taxes may not actually follow through with their plans

4
00:00:23,688 --> 00:00:31,584
According to Phil White, a British millionaire, "Tax the rich" placards were held next to the Congress center during the World Economic Forum (WEF) annual meeting in Davos on January 18, 2023

5
00:00:31,584 --> 00:00:39,479
However, it appears that these threats may be nothing more than empty posturing

6
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:47,375
In related news, Shekhar Koirala, a prominent figure within the Nepali Congress party, has been making headlines with a series of high-profile meetings

7
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:55,271
This has sparked speculation about the potential troubles facing Nepal's government

8
00:00:55,271 --> 00:01:03,167
Meanwhile, in the United States, Jesse Watters has made a statement regarding Governor Gavin Newsom's claims about a phone call between the two

9
00:01:03,167 --> 00:01:11,063
While Watters maintains that Newsom was not lying, the governor has responded by saying, "Well, see you in court, buddy

10
00:01:11,063 --> 00:01:18,959
" This exchange highlights the ongoing political tensions in the country

11
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:26,855
In other news, the export of white rice from Kakinada has come to a halt due to efforts to combat smuggling

12
00:01:26,855 --> 00:01:34,751
This development is significant, as it affects the distribution of cereal through ration shops in Andhra Pradesh

13
00:01:34,751 --> 00:01:42,646
Finally, the Congress party has called for the inclusion of socio-economic factors in the upcoming census, with the goal of breaking the 50% ceiling in the OBC quota

14
00:01:42,646 --> 00:01:50,542
This move reflects the ongoing efforts to address issues of inequality and social justice in Indian politics

15
00:01:50,542 --> 00:01:58,438
That's all for now

16
00:01:58,438 --> 00:02:06,334
Thank you for joining us tonight

17
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:14,230
