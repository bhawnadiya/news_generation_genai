Good evening, and welcome to our evening news broadcast. Today, we're focusing on the latest developments in politics, particularly in the state of Telangana.

First up, a new report suggests that millionaires who threaten to leave their home countries due to high taxes may not actually follow through with their plans. According to Phil White, a British millionaire, "Tax the rich" placards were held next to the Congress center during the World Economic Forum (WEF) annual meeting in Davos on January 18, 2023. However, it appears that these threats may be nothing more than empty posturing.

In related news, Shekhar Koirala, a prominent figure within the Nepali Congress party, has been making headlines with a series of high-profile meetings. This has sparked speculation about the potential troubles facing Nepal's government.

Meanwhile, in the United States, Jesse Watters has made a statement regarding Governor Gavin Newsom's claims about a phone call between the two. While Watters maintains that Newsom was not lying, the governor has responded by saying, "Well, see you in court, buddy." This exchange highlights the ongoing political tensions in the country.

In other news, the export of white rice from Kakinada has come to a halt due to efforts to combat smuggling. This development is significant, as it affects the distribution of cereal through ration shops in Andhra Pradesh.

Finally, the Congress party has called for the inclusion of socio-economic factors in the upcoming census, with the goal of breaking the 50% ceiling in the OBC quota. This move reflects the ongoing efforts to address issues of inequality and social justice in Indian politics.

That's all for now. Thank you for joining us tonight. We hope you have a great rest of your evening!
