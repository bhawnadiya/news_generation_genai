Good evening, and welcome to our evening news broadcast. Tonight, we're bringing you the latest updates on elections, policy changes, local governance, international relations, and Telangana politics.

First up, in a shocking move, the Trump administration has reportedly terminated the Department of Labor's only job training program for low-income seniors, just as older Americans are bracing for new work reporting requirements. This decision has been met with criticism from both sides of the aisle, with some calling it "cruel" and others expressing concern about the impact on vulnerable populations.

In Nepal, there's been a significant meeting today between former President Bidya Devi Bhandari and CPN-UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli, which has left political analysts buzzing. The details of the meeting are still unclear, but it's clear that this development could have major implications for the country's political landscape.

On the Senate side of the Capitol, things are heating up as Republicans plan to push forward with President Donald Trump's big tax breaks and spending cuts package. However, Democrats have their own headaches, with the 2026 Senate map looking tough for them. Both parties are gearing up for a fierce battle in next year's elections.

In a disturbing trend, more Americans are taking on extra jobs to cover debts, with 38% of respondents in a recent survey admitting to doing so. This phenomenon has been dubbed the "reluctant hustler," and it highlights the growing financial strain faced by many in the country.

In a positive development, the Grand Inga Hydropower Project is moving forward after years of delays, with the aim of providing energy for half of US homes. This project could have significant implications for global energy production and security.

In the realm of open source communities, the United Nations Digital Technology Network has adopted new Open Source Principles to promote collaboration and adoption of open-source technologies. This is a welcome development in the quest for more transparent and inclusive decision-making processes.

Finally, in Telangana politics, there's been a significant development with the Congress seeking socio-economic features in the census to break the 50% ceiling in OBC quota. This move could have major implications for the state's political landscape and social dynamics.

That's all for now. Thank you for joining us, and we'll see you tomorrow!
