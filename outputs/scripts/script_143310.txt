Good evening, and welcome to our evening news broadcast. Tonight, we'll be discussing several local governance, elections, Indian-related issues with Pakistan, international relations, and policy changes.

Firstly, in the realm of local governance, a new manifesto has been released by a prominent think tank, calling for the decentralization of power to every community. This move is seen as a significant step towards creating more accountable and responsive local governments.

Moving on to elections, a recent survey in Japan has revealed that tariffs are not a top priority for voters ahead of key upper house elections. This suggests that economic issues may not be the deciding factor in these elections.

In Indian-related news, there have been tensions between India and Pakistan over water resources management. However, diplomatic efforts are underway to resolve these issues peacefully.

Internationally, the United States has faced criticism for its diplomatic cuts, with some lawmakers calling for increased investment in foreign relations. Meanwhile, China is seen as a growing threat in the region, with some experts warning of a new war over river water resources.

In policy changes, there have been significant developments in the field of artificial intelligence. A recent report has highlighted the potential benefits of edge AI, while another study has examined the social aspect of water resources management in the Lake Chad Basin.

Finally, in House-passed defense bill, commercial satellite imagery, autonomy, and Golden Dome are all set to receive a significant boost. This highlights the growing importance of technology in national defense.

That's all for now. Thank you for joining us tonight. We'll have more news and analysis throughout the week. Goodnight!
